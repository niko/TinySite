h1. TinySite

TinySite is a static small site engine with "Heroku":http://heroku.com and "Dropbox":http://www.dropbox.com/ in mind. The idea is to host the app for a site on Heroku and take advantage of their awesome application stack and provide the static content by Dropbox.

The complete documentation is at tinysite.heroku.com, for a guide to get you started immediately go directly to the "installation and usage page":http://tinysite.herokuapp.com/installation_and_usage. The documentation app may serve you as a blueprint for your own app.

If you like TinySite and don't have a Dropbox account already: Supporting this project by using my "affiliate link":http://db.tt/zhjQbKF would be the easiest possibility to give back. And the best part is: When you use the affiliate link not only me, but you too get 250MB extra space on Dropbox.

If you want to get note of changes of the documentation please watch "the documentation app":https://github.com/niko/TinySitedocumentation_app and "the documentation files":https://github.com/niko/TinySitedocumentation_files on github.
